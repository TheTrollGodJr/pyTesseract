THE

AGE OF REASON.

Mab.

T bas been my intention, for feveral years

ft, to publifh my thoughts upon religion.

I am well aware of the difficulties that attend
the fubject ; and, from that confideration, had
referved it toa more advanced period of life. I
intended it to be the laft offering I fhould make
to my fellow citizens of all nations ; and that
at a time, when the purity of the motive that in-
luced me to it, could not admit of a queftion,
even by thefe who might difapprove the work.

The circumstance that has now taken place
in France, of the total abolition of the whole
national order of priefthood, and of every thing
appertaining to compullive fyftems of religion,
and compulfive articles of faith, has not only
precipitated my intention, but rendered a work
oi this kind exceedingly “neceflary ; left, in the
general wreck of fuperttition, of falfe {fyftems of
government, and falfe theology, we loci fight
of mor ality, of humanity, and of the theology
that is true.

As feveral of my colleagues, and others of
my fellow citizens of France, have .given me _.
the example of making their voluntary and in-
dividual preteiiion of faith, I alfo will make
mine ; and T do this with all that Gncerity and
franknefs with which the mind ef man com-
nunnentes with itfelf

Page 3
( 6 )

I believe in one Gad, and no more; and I
hope for happinefs beyond this life.

I believe the equality of man, aad T believe
that religious duties co:fift in doing juftice, lov-
ing mercy, and endeavouring ta raft our fel-
low creatures happy. ?

But left it thould be fuppofed that I believe
many oiher things i in addition to thefe, I fhall,

in the progrefs of this work, declare the things
I do not believe, and my reafons fer not believ-
ing them.

Ido not believe in the creed profeffed by the
Jewith church, by the Roman church, by the
Greek church, by the Turkifh church, by the
Proteftant church, nor by any church that I
know of My own mind is my own church.

All national inftitutions of churches, whe-
ther Jewith, Chriftian, or Turkith, eppear to
me no other than human inventions fet up to
terrify and enflave mankind, and monapolize
power and profit.

¥ do not mean by this declaration to condemn
thofe whe believe otherwife. They have the
fame right to their beliefas I have to mine.
But it ?s neceflary to the happinefs of man, that
he be mentally faithful to himfelf. Infidelity
does not confift in believing, or in difbelieving : :
it confifts in profefling te believe what he does
not beheve.

it is impofiuble to calculate the moral mif-

chief, 7 T may fo exprefs it, that mental lying
has proced in fociety. When a man‘has fo
‘corrupted and proftituted the c haftity of his
vind, es to fubieibe bis profelhonal belicf to

felf for the commiffion of every crime. He
takes up the trade of 2 prieft for the take of
gain, and in order to guahfy himfelf for that
trade, he begins with perjury. Can we conceive
any thing more deftructive to morality than
this ? .

Socn after I had publifhed the pampnlet,
COMMON SENSE, in America, I faw the ex-
ceeding probability that a revolution in the fyf-
tem of government, would be followed by a
revolution in the fyftem of religion. The adul-
terous connection of church and fate, where- |
ver it had taken place, whether Jewith, Chriiti-
on, or Turkifh, had fo effectually prohibited,
by pains and penalties, every difcuffion upon
eftablifhed creeds, and upon firft principles of
religion, that until the fyftem of government
fhould be changed, thofe fubjects could not be
brought fairly and openly before the world;
but that whenever this fhould be done, a revo-
lution in the fyftera of religion would follow.
Human inventions and prieft-craft would be
deteci:d ; and man would return to the pure,
unmixed, and unadulterated belief of one God,
and no more. .

Every national church or religion has efta-
blifhed itfelf by pretending fome {pecial miffion
from God communicated «. certain individuals.
The Jews have their Motes ; the Chriftians
their Jefus Chrift, their apoftles and faints ;
and the Turks their Makomet ; as if the way
to God was not open to every man alike.

Each of thofe churches fhow certain books
which they call revedatioz, or the word of God,
The Jews fay that their werd of Ged was civ-

Page 5
( 8)

en 7 God to Mofes face to face ; the Chriiti-
_ans fay, that their word of God came by divine
infpiration ; and the Turks fay, that their word
of God {the Koran} was broeght by an angel
from heaven. Each of thefe churches accufes
the other of unbclief; and, for my own prt,
I ditbelieve them ail. ,

Asit is neceilary toaffix right ideas to words,
I will, before I proceed farther into the fubject,
offer fome obfervations on the word revelstis7.
Revelation, whea applied to religion, means
fomething communicated immediately from God
to man.

No one will deny or difpute the power of the
Almighty to make fuch a communication if he
pleafes. But admitting, for the iake of a cate,
that fomething has been revealed to a certain
perfon, and not revealed to any other perion, it
is revelation to that perfon only. When he
tells it to a fecond perion, a a fecond to a third,
a third toa fourth, and fo on, it ceafes to he 2
revelation to all thofe perfons. It is revelation
to the firft perfop only, and Aearfay to every
other ; and confequently, they are not obliged
to helieve it.

It is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call

any thing arevelation that comes to us at fe-
cond hand, either verbally or in writing. Re-
velation is neceflarily limited to the firit com-
munication. After this, it is only an account
of fomething which that perfon fays was a re-
elation made to him ; and though he may
fiad himfli obliged to believe it, it cannot be
incumbent upon me to believe it in the fame
maner, for it was net a revelation made to rm,

Page 6
( 9 )
and i have only his word fer it that it was made
to drm. ee | .
When Moses told the children of iirsei thst
he received thé two tables of the command
ments from the hand of God, they were, not
obliged to believe him, becaufe they had no
other avthovity for it than his telling them 0 ;
and i have no other authority for it than fome-
hiftorian telling me fo. The commandments
carry no internal evidence of divinity with
them. They contain fome good moral precepts,
fuch as any man qualified to be a law-giver or
alegiflator could produce himfelf, witheut bav-
ing recourte to fupernatural intervention.*

_- When I am told that the Koran was written
in heaven, and brought to Mahomet by an an-
gel, the account comes to near the fame kind
of hearfay evidence, and fecond hand authority,
as the former. I did not fee the angel myfelf, ~
and therefore have a right not to believe it.» -

When alfo I am told that a woman, called’
the Virgin Mary, faid, or gave out, that the
was with child without an¥ cohabitation with
a man, and that her betrothed hufband, Jofeph,
faid, that an angel told him fo, I havea right
to believe them or not: fuch a circumftance
required a much ftronger evidence than their
bare word for it: but we have not even this ;
for neither Jofeph nor Mary wrote any fuch
matter themielves. It is only reported by others
that they faid fo. It is hearfay upon hearfay,

* I, is, however, neceTury to except the deciaration which
fays, that God wiffts the fins of the fatders uponste children, It ia
centrary to every principle of moral juice.

and I de not chufe to-reft my beticf upon fuch
evidence. oo |
leis, however, not diffcalgto account for
the credit that was given tothe flory of Jefus
Chnit’s being the Son of God. “He was born
ata tine when the heathen mythology had
fill force faihion and repute in the world, and
that mythology had. prepared the people for the
belief of fucha ftory. Almoftall the extraor-
dinary men that lived ander the heathen my-
thology were reputed to be the fons of fome of
their guds. It was not-a-new thing at that
time to. believe aman to have been celcitially
begotten : the intertourfe of gods with women
was then a master of familiar opinion.. Their
Jupites, according totheir accounts, had cohab-
ited with hundreds : the ftory, therefore, bad
nothing im iteither new, wonderful, or obfcene:
it was conformable to the opinions that then
prevailed amesg the people called Gentiles, or
raythologifts, and it was thofe people only that
believed it. The Jews who had kept ftridtly to
the belief of one God, and no more, and who
had always rejected the heathen mythology, ne-
ver credited the ftory.
‘Tt is curious to obferve how the theory of
what is called the Chriftian church, fprung out
of the tail of the heathen mythology. A di-
rectincorporation took place in the firft inftance,
by making the reputed founder to be celeftially
begatton. The trinity of gods that then fel-
lowed was no other than a reduction of the
former plurality, which was about twenty cr
thirty thoufand. The ftatue of Mary fucceeded
the ftatue of Diana of Ephefus. The deifica-


Page 8
tion of heroes, changed into the cannonization
of faints. - The mythologifts had sods for eve-
ae Ghriftian. mytholog’fts had faints

ori every thing. aT he charch became as crond-

ed. with cheione, as the pantheon had been with
the other; and Rome was the place of both.

The Chriftian theory is little elfe than the ido-
latry of the antient my thologifts, accommoda-
ted.to the purpofes of power and revenue; and
it yet remains to reafon and philofophy to abol-
ith the amphibious fraud.

Nothing that is here. aid caa apply, even
with the moft diftant difrefpect, to the real cha-
racter of Jefus Chrift. He was a virtuous and
an amiable man. The morality that he preach-
ed and practifed. was of the moft benevolent
kind ; and though Gmilar fyftems of morality
had been preached by Confucius, and by fome
of the Greek philofophers, many years before ; _
by the Quakers fince ; and by many good men -
in all | ages 5 it has not been exceeded by any.

jefus Chrift wrote no account of himfelf, of
his birth, parentage, or any thingelfe. Nota
line of what is called the New Teftament is of
his writing. The hiftory of him is altogether
the work of other people ; and as to the account
given of his refurrection and afcengon, it was
the neceflary counterpart to the ftory of his
birth. His hiftorians, having brought him in-
to the world in a fupernatural manner, were
obliged to take him out agaia in the fame man-
ner, or the firft part of the ftory muft have fal-
Jen to the ground.

The wretched contrivance with which this
latter partis told, exceeds every thing that went

Page 9
( 12)

before it. The firtt part, that of the miraculous
conception, was not a thing that edmitted of
publicity ; and therefore the teHeANf this part
of the ftory, had this advanfage,-that though
they might act be credited, ‘they ‘could not be
detected. ‘They could not be expected to:prove
it, becaufe it-was not one of thofe things that
admitted’ of proof, and it Was impofible that the
perion of- whom it was told could prove it
himfclf.

But the selurrention of a dead perfon from
the grave, and his afcenfion through the air, is
a thing very different as to the evidence it ad-
mits of, to the invifible conception of a child
inthe womb, The refurrection and e{enfion,
fuppoting them to have taker: place, admitted
‘of public and occular demonfration, like that
of the afcenfion of a balioon, or the fun at noon
_ .day, to al Jerefalem at leaft. A thing which
every body is required to believe, requires that
the proof and evidence of it fhould be equal'to
all, and univerfal; and as the public vifibility
of this laft related act was the only evidence

that could give {anction to the former part, the
whole of it falls to the'ground, becaufe the
evidence never was given. Initesd of this, a

fonall number of perfons, not more than eight
or nine, are introduced as proxies foi the whole
world, to fay, they few it, and all the reftof the
“world are called upon to believe it. But it ap-
pears that Thornas did not believe the refurrec-

tion ; and, as they fay, would not believe, with-

out having occular and manual demonftration
himfelf. So newzther will I; and the reafon is
equally as good for me and for every other per-

the univerfe. He prays dictatorily. When it |
is fun-thine,. he prays for rain, and when it is
rain, he prays for fun-fhine.- He follows the
fame idea in every thing-that he prays for ; for
what is the amount of all his. prayers, but-an
attempt to.make the Almighty change his mind,
and act otherwife than he does. ~ It is as if he
were to fay—thou knoweft Rot fo well as I.

BUT fome perhaps will fay, Are we to have
~ no word of God—No revelatign ?I anfwer yes.
There is a word of God ; thére isa revelation.
THE WORD OF GOD Is THE GRATION WE
BeHoLtp: And it isin this werd, which no
human invention can counterfeit or alter, that —
God {peaketh univerfally to man.
Human language is local and changeable, |
and is therefore incapable o: being ufed as the
means of unchangeable and univ erfal informa-
tion. The idea that God fent Jefus Chrift to
publifh, as they jay, the glad tidings to all na- -
tions, from one end of the earth unto the other,
is confiftent only with the ignorance of thofe
who knew ncthing of the extent of the world,
and who believed, as thofe world-faviours be-
lieved, and continued to believe, for feveral cen-
turies (and that in contradictign to the difco-
veries of philofophers, and the experience of na-
vigators) that the earth was flat like a trench-
er; and that a man might walk to the end ofit.
‘But how was Jefus Chrift to make any thing
known to all nations? He could fpeak but
one Teaguage, which was Hebrew; and there
are in the world feveral hundred languages,

Scarcely any two nations {peak the fame lan-
guage, or underftand each other ; and as to
rranflations, évery man who Knows any thing
of: languages, :-knows that it is impofible to
tranflate from: one language into another not
only without lofing a great. part of the origi-
nal; but frequently of miftaking the fenie:
and befides all this, the art of printing was
wholly unknown at the time Chrift lived. ,
It is always neceffary that the means that.
are to accomplifh any end, be ¢qual to the ac-
complifhment of that-end, or the end cannot
be accomplifhed.- Ie-is-in this, that the dif-
ference between. figite and infinite power and
wifdem difcovers itfelf. Man frequently_fails
in accomplhifhiiy hgs end, from a natural ina-
bility of power to the purpofe ; and fre-
quently from the want of wifdom to apply
power properly. But itis impoffible for inf-
nite power and wifdom to fail as man faileth.
The means ig ufeth are always equal-to the
end :. but human language, more efpecially as
there is. not an univerbl language, is incapable
of being ufed.as an univerfal means of un-
changeable and uniform information; ahd
therfore itis not the means that God ufeth in
manifefting himfelf univerfaliy to man.
It is only in the CREATION that all our adeag
and conceptions of a werd zf God can unite.
The creation fpeaketh an univerfal language,
independently of human fpeech or human lan-
guage, multiplied and various as they be. | It
is an ever exifting original, which every mat
can read. It cannot be forged; it camgipt be
counterfeited ; it cannot be loft ; it cannot be

in his not withholding that abundance ever

the {cripture, which any human hand might
make, but the fcripture called the Creation.
The only idea man can afix:to the name of
God, is, that of a fr? .ceufe, the caufe of all
things. And incomprehenfibly difficult as it is
for man to conceive what a firft caufe is, he ar-
rives at the belief of it, from the tenfold greater
difficulty of difbelieving it: It is difficult be-
yond. defcription to conceive that {pace can have
noend ; but it is more difficult to conceive an
end. It is dificale beyond the power of man
to conceive an eternal duration of what we call
time ; but it is more impoffible to conceive a
time when there fhall be no time. In like man-
ner of reafoning, every thing we behold carries
in itfelf the internal evidence that it did not

felf, that he did. not make himélf ; . neither
tould his. father make- himfelf, nor his grand-
father, nor any-of-his-rade ;° neither couid any
tite, ‘plant; ‘or animal, “niake itfelf : “and it-is
the conviction: arifing from this evidence, that
carries. us on, as.it were, by neceffity, to the be-
lief of a firft caufe eternally exifting, of a nature
totally different ‘to any material exiftence we
know of, and by. the power of which all things
exift, and this firft caufé man calls God.

Ttis only by the. exercife of reafon, that man
can‘ difcover ‘God.: ‘Fake away that reafon,
_ and he would be. incapable of underftanding any

thing ; and, in this cafe, it would be juft as
coniiftent to.read-even the book called. the Bi-
ble, to:a chorf as to a man.- How then is it
that thofe people pretend to reject reafon ?
 Almoft.-the only parts in the book, called
the Bible, that convey to us any idea of God,
are. fome chapters in Job, and the 19th pfaim.

I recallect no other. Thofe parts are true d-
« ifical compofitions; for they treat of the De:ty
through his works. They takethe book of Crea-

tion as the word of God ;_ they refer to no other
book ; and all the inferences they make are
drawn from that volume, —

I infert, in this place, the 19th pfalm, as
paraphrafed into Englifh verfe by Addifon. I
recollect not the profe, and where [ write this
I have not an opportunity of feeing it.

ad net fome record or fome tradition, that it
was originally no other than a pious fraud, or
did not foreiee, that it could not ‘be maintained
azainft the evidence that the ftrudture of the
viiverte afforded.

HAVING thus fhewn the irreconcileable
inconfiitencies between the real word of Ged
exifting in the univerfe, and that which is call-
ed, the ward of God as fhewn to us in a printed
book, that any man might make, I proceed to
fpeak of the three principal means ‘that have
been employed in all ages, and perhaps in all
countries, ta impofe upon mankind.

Thofe three means are, Myftery, Miracle,
and Prophecy. The two firft are incompatible
with true religion, and the third ought always
to be iuipected.

With refpect to myftery, every thing we be-
hold is, in one fenfe, a myftery to us. ur
own exi(tence is a myftery : the whole vegeta-
bie world is a miftery. We cannot account
how it ts that an acorn, when put into the
ground, is made to develone itfelf, and become
an oak. We know not how it is that the feed
we fow unfolds and muitiplies itfelf, and re-
turns te us fuch an abundant intereft for fo
fmall a capital.

The fact, however, as diftin@ from the one-
rating caufe, is not a myftery becaufe we fee it;
and we know alfo the means we are to ule,
which is no other than putting the fed in the
ground. Weknow therefore 2 as much as is ne-
ceffary for us to know ; and that part of the


Page 15
( 72 )

operation that we do not. know, and which if
we did, we could not perform, the Creator takes
upon himiclf and performs it for us. We are
therefore better off than if we had been let into
the fecret, and left to do it for ourfelves.

But though every created thing is in this
fenfe a myftery, the word myftery cannot be

applied to moral truth, any more than obfcurity
can be applied to light. The God in whom
we believe is a God of moral truth, and nota
God of myftery or obfcurity. Myftery is the
antagonift of truth. It is a fog of human in-
vention, that cbfcures truth and reprefents it in
diftortion. Truth never invelopes i/e/f in myi-
_tery ; and the myftery in which it is at any
_ time inveloped, is the work of its antagonift,
and never of it&lf.

Religion, therefore, being the belief of a God,
and the practice of moral truth, cannot have
connection with myftery. The belief of a
God, fo far from having any thing of myftery
init, is of all beliefs the moft eafy, becaufe it
arifes to us, as is before obferved, out of necef-
fity. And the practice of moral truth, or in
other words, a practical imitation of the moral

. goodnefs of God, is no other than our acting
towards each other, as he acts benignly towards
all. We cannot jerve God in the manner we
_ferve thofe who cannot do without fuch fervice;
_ and, therefore, the only idea we can have of
ferving God, is that of contributing to the hap-
: pinefs rat the living creation that God has made.
This cannot be done by retiring from the
| foci icty of the world, and {pending a a reclofe life
| in felfifh devotion.

be told, could not tell whether the mar. prophe-
fied or lied, or whether it had been ‘evcaicd to
him, or whether he conceited it: and-if the
ihing that he prophelied, or pretended to pro=
phecy, fhould happen, or» fomethixg like a6
among the multitude of thinss tiarare chily
happening, nobody could again nar vy whether
he joreknew it, or cueffed at it, OF whether
was accidental. A prophet, therefor. ty isa cha-
racter ufelefg and unneceffary ; and the fafe fide |
of the cafe is, to guard againtt ‘being: impofed
upon by not giving credit to fuch relations.
Upon the whole, myitery, miracie, and pro-
phecy, are appendages that belong to fabulous
and not to true religion. They sre the means
br which fo many Lo eres / and Lo theres !
ee been fpread a about the world, and religion
been made into a irade. The fuccefs of one
impojtor gave encouragement to another, and
the quieting falvo of doing fame good by keeping
up a pias fraud, protected them from remorte.
Having now extended the fuvject to a greater
length than I firft intended, 1 fhall bring it to
a clofe by abftracting a fummary from the whole.
Firft, That the idea or belief of a word of |
God exifting in print, or in writing, or in
foeech, is inconfiftent in itfelf for the reafons
alrealy atgned. Thefe reafons, among many
others, are “the want of an univerfal language ;
the mutability of language; the errors to which
tranflations are fubject; the paiiibility of totally
ruppretiing fuch a word ; the probability of ai-
siing it, or of fabricating the whole, and im-
poling upon the world.
Secondly, That the creation we behold is the
